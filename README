Creating a UDP connection in C involves setting up a socket, preparing the server and client code, and sending and receiving data packets over the socket. Hereâ€™s a basic example showing both a UDP server and client.

UDP Server Code (C)
The server waits for a message from a client and echoes it back.

UDP Client Code (C)
The client sends a message to the server and waits for a response.

Explanation
Server Side:

Creates a UDP socket using socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0).
Binds the socket to the specified port (PORT) and listens for messages.
Receives messages from a client and sends the same message back.
Client Side:

Creates a UDP socket.
Sends a message to the server using sendto.
Receives the response from the server using recvfrom.
Compile and Run
Compile the server and client programs:

bash
gcc -o udp_server udp_server.c
gcc -o udp_client udp_client.c

Start the server:
bash
./udp_server
In a separate terminal, start the client:

bash
./udp_client
This setup provides a simple UDP connection where the client can send messages to the server, which echoes them back.
